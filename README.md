# Instance-Segmentation-Counting

# Project Overview
In this project, I have developed an instance segmentation and counting system using the YOLOv8 segmentation model. The primary goal of this system is to detect, segment, and count instances of people in a video feed. This system can be particularly useful for applications such as crowd monitoring, people counting in events, and security surveillance.

# Features
Instance Segmentation: Utilizing the YOLOv8 segmentation model to accurately segment instances of people in each frame.

Object Tracking: Tracking individual instances across frames using unique identifiers.

Counting Mechanism: Implementing a polygonal region within the video frame to count the number of people entering the specified area.

Visualization: Drawing segmentation masks and bounding boxes on detected instances for visual representation.
